- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- Spec covers both unit tests (no external deps) and functional
  tests (MCP tools against real database).
- Components and tools enumerated based on features 001-004.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
